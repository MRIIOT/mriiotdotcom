      "problem": "No Visibility into Machine Performance",
      "solution": "Legacy machines running blind with no data collection. The SHARC IoT sensor adapter connects any sensor to any network, giving you real-time visibility into machine status, performance, and health without replacing existing equipment."
    },
    {
      "problem": "Data Silos Across the Factory",
      "solution": "Different machines speaking different protocols with no unified view. Our integration platform supports 25+ source protocols and 15+ sink protocols, creating a unified data pipeline from any equipment to any enterprise system."

      "problem": "Unplanned Downtime",
      "solution": "Unexpected machine failures disrupting production schedules and costing thousands per hour. Predictive analytics based on real-time sensor data help you predict and prevent shutdowns before they happen."

    {
      "problem": "Manual Data Collection",
      "solution": "Operators recording machine data on clipboards and spreadsheets — slow, error-prone, and impossible to analyze at scale. Automated data collection eliminates manual effort and provides accurate, real-time information."

      "problem": "IT/OT Disconnect",
      "solution": "Factory floor systems isolated from enterprise IT, creating blind spots in business intelligence. We bridge the IT/OT gap with secure, reliable connectivity between operational technology and information systems."

    {
      "problem": "Legacy Equipment Can't Connect",
      "solution": "Older machines with no built-in connectivity being left behind in digital transformation. The SHARC adapter retrofits any machine with IoT capability — no equipment replacement needed."
